Navigate to the app > java > your app’s package name > Right-click on it > New > Java class and name it as RecyclerData and add the below code to it.
Comments are added inside the code to understand the code in more detail.

CODE

public class RecyclerData {
    // string variables for our data
    // make sure that the variable name
    // must be similar to that of key value
    // which we are getting from our json file.
    private String courseName;
    private String courseimg;
    private String courseMode;
    private String courseTracks;
 
    public String getCourseName() {
        return courseName;
    }
 
    public void setCourseName(String courseName) {
        this.courseName = courseName;
    }
 
    public String getCourseimg() {
        return courseimg;
    }
 
    public void setCourseimg(String courseimg) {
        this.courseimg = courseimg;
    }
 
    public String getCourseMode() {
        return courseMode;
    }
 
    public void setCourseMode(String courseMode) {
        this.courseMode = courseMode;
    }
 
    public String getCourseTracks() {
        return courseTracks;
    }
 
    public void setCourseTracks(String courseTracks) {
        this.courseTracks = courseTracks;
    }
 
    public RecyclerData(String courseName, String courseimg, String courseMode, String courseTracks) {
        this.courseName = courseName;
        this.courseimg = courseimg;
        this.courseMode = courseMode;
        this.courseTracks = courseTracks;
    }
}
Step 6: Creating an Interface class for our API Call

Navigate to the app > java > your app’s package name > Right-click on it > New > Java class select it as Interface and name the file as RetrofitAPI and add below code to it. Comments are added inside the code to understand the code in more detail.

import retrofit2.Call;
import retrofit2.http.GET;
 
public interface RetrofitAPI {
 
    // as we are making get request
    // so we are displaying GET as annotation.
    // and inside we are passing
    // last parameter for our url.
    @GET("63OH")
     
    // as we are calling data from array
    // so we are calling it with json object
    // and naming that method as getCourse();
    Call<RecyclerData> getCourse();
}
